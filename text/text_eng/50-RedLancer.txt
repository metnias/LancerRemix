He... hello
90 : 20 : Hello tiny... creature. You... you did this?
One moment. My memory isn't responding. I... I have no idea...
...must have been gone for...
0 : 40 : ...
40 : 40 : Oh.
NSH, is that you?
Did you wake me up?
If only we could speak. I have so many questions.
If things are as they seem... thank you.
40 : 0 : But, your friend... Even in my state, I can tell they're not well.
I am so sorry to say, but they do not have much time left. You need to get them back to your chamber at once.<LINE>If you believed I could help them once they arrived, I'm sorry.
And you, courier... I have known very few beings who could aspire to such a noble thing as you.<LINE>You really are... an amazing tiny creature.
10 : 20 : I wish I could say I will always remember what you two have done for me.
0 : 40 : ...
20 : 0 : Tiny friend. Perhaps you already know this, and I don't know what consolation it might bring, but if this sickness takes you...
40 : 0 : You will wake right back up again.
