OA OA, it is my little berry. I have been watching you.

It is nice to have a companion, after all this time.

For so long I have drifted. Lost.

Dispersed in the multitudes of the waves and the ripples.

But following your thread brings me closer, perhaps, to how I was.

Maybe because you remind me of myself, back when I still had goop of my own.

And of myself now. We both never got our big legs. And now we never will.
