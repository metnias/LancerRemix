OAOAOA! It is this thing! Have you really not been eaten?

Well well well well! Not in this strand, no.

But don’t be too proud OAOAOA!! I can see your reflections, yes!!

Behold: Chomped by a flying thing!

Torn to ribbons by a crawling thing!

Pulled into the earth by wiggling things!! OAOAOAOAOA!!!

A world of teeth! and claws! and beaks! and pressures! and acids!

Forever-where and forever-when! OAOAOA-OA?!?!

This one! You're big! WELL, bigger. No match for the crushing thing!!

How intriguing! Your most distant reflections show a tall beast in your place.

You're a sphere and it's a stick! I wonder what's different in this ripple.
