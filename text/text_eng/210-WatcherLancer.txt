Oh.

Here I am again.

The bath. The pipes. The gravel.

The mournful geometry.

This sluice through which a departed one's essence flows,

so undignified.

A soup of proteins and acids.

Must we be this?

0 : 30 : ...

I traveled through that thin grate, and yet I stayed.

All my mothers and fathers and crechemates who went along without me...

Do they note my absence?

I've traveled from the furthest future to the very seed of our past, and I saw no evidence.

Only echoes and strays.

Aloof. Alone.

Afraid.

0 : 30 : ...

Except you.

I have a new creche now. You and me.

Us together in eternal youth. Running through the ripples.

But now it is time.

I will abandon this eternal waiting room.

I will step through the white door.

I will accept what is next.

0 : 160 : ...

OAOAOA!

Thank you. For noting my absence. For going with me.

I will wait for you there until we can run again.
