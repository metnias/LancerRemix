0Hello <PlayerName>. Are you lost?
0 : 40 : ...
40 : 0 : Oh.
Tiny creature...
You are not well.
I am so sorry to say, but you do not have much time left.
You reminds me of my last visitor. They were also very sick, so they weren't here very long.
Maybe you know them? You both share similar affliction,<LINE>so I can only imagine you two already knew each other.
My last overseer watched them head to the west. Perhaps you can catch them if you hurry.
