Another one, and so soon. I always knew you were kind deep down despite your blas√© attitude, NSH.
You've sent an overseer this time. Wanted to hear my gratitude for yourself, I presume?~
If only you could communicate through it... I have so many questions. What does everyone think happened to me?
40 : 40 : ...No Significant Harassment, if your equipment is still viable, please broadcast a message in the public channels for me.
Tell them that I am fine. Tell them my communication equipment was damaged by Five Pebbles, but I managed to calm him,<LINE>and that I am still diligently working toward our goal. I want them to hold on to hope for as long as possible.
40 : 40 : Relay this for me and I will be at peace. It is my final wish.
0 : 40 : ...

40 : 0 : Oh.
Tiny creature... I almost forgot you were there.
I can see that you are not well.
I am so sorry to say, but you do not have much time left, just like the last messenger. I wonder why...
SPECEVENT : lunterlook
Surely my friend here has a plan to help you. NSH, would you please guide them back to your can when you're done?
SPECEVENT : lunterlook
Thank you, my friends. What you've done for me is beyond extraordinary.
0 : 60 : I will cherish this memory for as long as I can.
