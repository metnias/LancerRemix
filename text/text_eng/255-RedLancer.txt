Oh, hello again.
There is nothing here. Not even my memories remain.
I don't know why you've come back. Where's NSH's overseer? Are you lost?
I wish I could help you... But like this, there is very little I can do.
20 : 0 : If NSH's overseer doesn't come back, all I can do is...
0 : 40 : ...
20 : 0 : Tiny friend. Perhaps you already know this, and I don't know what consolation it might bring, but...
40 : 0 : You will wake right back up again.
