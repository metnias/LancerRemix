Eight additional slag reset keys! This truly does mean a lot.
Though not as much as last time- understandable, since they're so time consuming to produce.
The gesture is incredibly kind, but unfortunately I have no more use for them. Since my structure fell,<LINE>the vast majority of my systems have been damaged beyond what any software purge can repair.
It's like lubricating the joinery of a demolished sky-sail. It can never be returned to full working capacity,<LINE>but a small part of the old self is preserved.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful. Your dedication and care is more than I could ever ask, even if I'll never take flight again.
