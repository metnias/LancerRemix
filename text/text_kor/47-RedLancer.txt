As I feared, here you are. Empty handed.
He was never one to think ahead. His last messenger came through here not so long ago.
So too did it visit my can as you have. Though at least that one didn't lose its payload.<LINE>He should have at least equipped you with more than an overseer.
What else to expect from a cub. What else did they think would happen?<LINE>Not only did you abandon the delivery, you managed to travel<LINE>a more treacherous path to the wrong destination.
I am furious with him. Does he not see the irony? Or does he just not care, like our creators?<LINE>The more bugs in the maze the better, after all. Doomed with purpose from the start. We never stood a chance.

Tiny creature, you are not healthy. We are alike not only in our burdens, but in our condition too.
It is an injustice that you have to deal with this sickness at such a young age. I would not feel right if I didn't try to help in any way I can.
SPECEVENT : karma
I hope I have repaid what little time you have that was spent coming here.
You can use your remaining time for a greater purpose. There is still a chance for your salvation, little one.<LINE>Far west, beyond the Farm Arrays, there is a fissure, through which you can begin your descent.<LINE>Slip deeper and deeper until the roiling void seeps into the very soil. There lies your freedom.
Your only purpose is to save yourself now. No more burdens. No more tasks. No more problems.
0 : 30 : Please stay safe, child. This may be your best shot at ascension in one thousand thousand lifetimes. It'd be a shame to waste it.
